# xErlang

Exercism exercises in Erlang.

For each test there is a directory, which contains two files, e.g., in the `bob` dir
there is `bob_test.erl` and `example.erl`. The example file define a module with the
name `bob`, so that we can use it to check that the tests are running as they should.
The users of exercism will create their own `bob.erl` file and `bob_test` will test it.
