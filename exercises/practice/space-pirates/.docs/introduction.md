# Introduction

In the 30th century, interstellar travel has become commonplace, and with it, the age-old profession of piracy has expanded to the stars. Captains with fast ships and loyal crews plunder trade routes across the galaxy, always staying one step ahead of the Imperial Fleet.

You've recently joined the crew of the notorious Captain Nova, whose fleet of pirate ships is known throughout the Perseus Arm. As the new communications officer, you've been tasked with implementing their distributed messaging system. The previous officer was spaced after a critical failure that left three ships stranded during a raid on an Imperial convoy.

"Listen carefully," Captain Nova tells you on your first day. "Our ships operate across vast distances. A fleet is only as strong as its communication network. When a ship goes down—and they do go down—I need to know immediately. If a ship sends a distress signal, it needs to reach command with proper authentication. No Imperial interference, no message spoofing. And most importantly, when we lose a ship, I need an immediate replacement dispatched. Understood?"

You gulp nervously. "I'll need to use **Erlang**'s concurrency model—processes, links, monitors, and references."
Captain Nova grins. "*Precisely*. Now get to work before I find another communications officer."
