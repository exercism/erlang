# Series

Given a string of digits, output all the contiguous substrings of length `n` in
that string.

For example, the string "49142" has the following 3-digit series:

- 491
- 914
- 142

And the following 4-digit series:

- 4914
- 9142

And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you deserve
whatever you get.

Note that these series are only required to occupy *adjacent positions*
in the input; the digits need not be *numerically consecutive*.

## Running tests

In order to run the tests, issue the following command from the exercise
directory:

For running the tests provided, `rebar3` is used as it is the official build and
dependency management tool for erlang now. Please refer to [the tracks installation
instructions](http://exercism.io/languages/erlang/installation) on how to do that.

In order to run the tests, you can issue the following command from the exercise
directory.

```bash
$ rebar3 eunit
```

### Test versioning

Each problem defines a macro `TEST_VERSION` in the test file and
verifies that the solution defines and exports a function `test_version`
returning that same value.

To make tests pass, add the following to your solution:

```erlang
-export([test_version/0]).

test_version() ->
  1.
```

The benefit of this is that reviewers can see against which test version
an iteration was written if, for example, a previously posted solution
does not solve the current problem or passes current tests.

environment expected by the exercises.
