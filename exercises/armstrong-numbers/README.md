# Armstrong Numbers

An [Armstrong number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_number) is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

For example:

- 9 is an Armstrong number, because `9 = 9^1 = 9`
- 10 is *not* an Armstrong number, because `10 != 1^2 + 0^2 = 1`
- 153 is an Armstrong number, because: `153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153`
- 154 is *not* an Armstrong number, because: `154 != 1^3 + 5^3 + 4^3 = 1 + 125 + 64 = 190`

Write some code to determine whether a number is an Armstrong number.

## Running tests

In order to run the tests, issue the following command from the exercise
directory:

For running the tests provided, `rebar3` is used as it is the official build and
dependency management tool for erlang now. Please refer to [the tracks installation
instructions](http://exercism.io/languages/erlang/installation) on how to do that.

In order to run the tests, you can issue the following command from the exercise
directory.

```bash
$ rebar3 eunit
```

### Test versioning

Each problem defines a macro `TEST_VERSION` in the test file and
verifies that the solution defines and exports a function `test_version`
returning that same value.

To make tests pass, add the following to your solution:

```erlang
-export([test_version/0]).

test_version() ->
  1.
```

The benefit of this is that reviewers can see against which test version
an iteration was written if, for example, a previously posted solution
does not solve the current problem or passes current tests.

## Questions?

This covers the basic information on setting up the development
environment expected by the exercises.
