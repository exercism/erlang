# Dominoes

Make a chain of dominoes.

Compute a way to order a given set of dominoes in such a way that they form a
correct domino chain (the dots on one half of a stone match the dots on the
neighbouring half of an adjacent stone) and that dots on the halves of the
stones which don't have a neighbour (the first and last stone) match each other.

For example given the stones `[2|1]`, `[2|3]` and `[1|3]` you should compute something
like `[1|2] [2|3] [3|1]` or `[3|2] [2|1] [1|3]` or `[1|3] [3|2] [2|1]` etc, where the first and last numbers are the same.

For stones `[1|2]`, `[4|1]` and `[2|3]` the resulting chain is not valid: `[4|1] [1|2] [2|3]`'s first and last numbers are not the same. 4 != 3

Some test cases may use duplicate stones in a chain solution, assume that multiple Domino sets are being used.

## Running tests

In order to run the tests, issue the following command from the exercise
directory:

For running the tests provided, `rebar3` is used as it is the official build and
dependency management tool for erlang now. Please refer to [the tracks installation
instructions](http://exercism.io/languages/erlang/installation) on how to do that.

In order to run the tests, you can issue the following command from the exercise
directory.

```bash
$ rebar3 eunit
```

## Questions?

For detailed information about the Erlang track, please refer to the

This covers the basic information on setting up the development
environment expected by the exercises.
